# Aseprite-AnimateDecreaseHueSat
Created for Aseprite v1.x

A little aseprite script that lets you specify a number of frames over which to change the HSL values of a selected cel.

Simply save the lua file into your Aseprite scripts folder (you can find that by clicking File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder), refresh your scripts (press F5) and then select a cel you want to animate the HSL change on and then run the script (File > Scripts > AnimatedChangeHSL). The cel will be altered by the amount you type in for each field for however many frames you want (as in, if you enter -10 for the hue, and 5 for the frame number, the last cel will have their hue altered by -50). Simple stuff.
